# June 2018 Audit
The first comprehensive audit was done in june 2018. The whole Badgr code (excluding most dependencies), SURFnet's additions to it, the Open Badge concept/implementation of the specification and the development environment of SURFnet were part of the audit. Through static analysis and dynamic analysis, issues were found.
